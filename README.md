# Movie List Creator
 
## The Problem

I needed to create a simple way for people to nominate five of their favourite movies

## Features
- Allows you to search for movie titles
- Nominate movies to be part of your nominees list
- Remove movies from your nominees list
- Give "star ratings" to each of your nominees
- Has a shareable URL so you can show everyone your top 5 favourite movies and their star ratings
- As long as you bookmark the URL are you've made changes to the "star ratings" or nominees, then you'll have it saved to be able to work on it later

## How

This project was built using React.js. Since the app is pretty small, React Hooks were used for state management

## Using the web app
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm start` in your terminal. This will start a local server running on your localhost:3000 port
